Al-Hijr features well-preserved rock-cut tombs, temples, and inscriptions, offering a glimpse into the lives of the Nabateans.

The site is not as well-known as others but holds great historical significance.\n",

            "5. **Dates and Arabic Coffee** â€“ No meal in Saudi Arabia is complete without dates, which are a staple food and symbolize hospitality. They are often served with Arabic coffee (gahwa), a sweet, strong coffee brewed with cardamom and served in a small cup called a \"dallah.\"\n",
